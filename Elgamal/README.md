One script is for Bob, and another for Alice:

For your bob script, the input will be of the form:
p
g
A
a

with Alice's secret being 'a'. The script will calculate c1 and c2. The variable 'm' is provided by the user. The output should be a txt file of the form:
p
g
a
c1
c2

This output will be the input for the second script, where Bob's message 'm' is calculated.
