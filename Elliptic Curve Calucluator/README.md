For this script, I am taking an input in 1 of 2 possible forms.

Form 1:
A
B
prime number p
point P
integer a

Form 2:
A
B
prime number p
point P
point Q

If the input is form 1, the script will calculate a * P. If the input is form 2, the script will calculate P + Q.

A version of the above code can identify and handle big O (the additive identity). A function for subtracting points (input will be of form 2, the script will calculate P - Q)
