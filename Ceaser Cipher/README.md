A python script which reads and decrypts an input file containing a ciphertext encrypted by a caesar cipher of unknown key. The input file is named input.txt. The script will either A) write the decrypted message on an output file, output.txt or B) clearly print the decrypted message when run. The plaintext message (before encryption) will be in plain English with properly spelled words. The message will not be long enough for frequency analysis to work.
